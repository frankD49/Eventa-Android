This Privacy Policy describes how KOSD ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile applications, ClockCard and Eventa (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

1.1 Account Information
- Email address (used for authentication and account recovery)
- First name and last name (used for display within your organization)
- Encrypted password (managed by our authentication provider; we never see the plaintext)

1.2 Location Data
- When you check in or check out, we may collect your device's GPS coordinates at that moment in time.
- Location is only collected during an explicit check-in or check-out action. We do NOT track your location continuously or in the background.
- Location data is used solely to verify that you are within the geofence of your designated workplace, if your organization has enabled location verification.
- You may decline location permission. If you do, check-in/check-out will still work but will be marked as "location not verified."

1.3 Attendance Data
- Check-in and check-out timestamps
- Attendance status (present, late, absent, early departure, remote, on leave)
- Notes you optionally add to check-in/check-out records
- Late and early departure durations (calculated server-side)

1.4 Organization Data
- Your role within an organization (owner, admin, or member)
- The organization(s) you belong to
- Invite codes you create or use

1.5 Device and Usage Data
- App version and device model (for debugging and compatibility)
- Crash reports (if you opt in)

2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

- To authenticate you and manage your account
- To record and report your attendance to your organization's administrators

- To comply with legal obligations

3. LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING (GDPR)

- Contract performance: Processing your attendance data is necessary to provide the Service you requested as part of your employment arrangement.
- Consent: Location data collection during check-in/check-out requires your explicit consent. You can withdraw consent at any time in Settings.
- Legitimate interests: We process aggregated, anonymized data for service improvement and security.

4. DATA SHARING

- Your organization's administrators (owners and admins) can view your attendance records, check-in/out times, and attendance status within their organization.
- We do NOT sell your personal data to third parties.
- We share data with our service providers (authentication, hosting) only as necessary to operate the Service, under data processing agreements.
- We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our legal rights.

5. DATA RETENTION

- Attendance records are retained for a period determined by your organization's data retention setting (default: 365 days).
- You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time via Settings > Delete Account.
- When you delete your account, your profile, attendance records, consent records, and organization memberships are permanently deleted within 30 days.

6. YOUR RIGHTS

- Access: You can request a copy of your personal data.
- Rectification: You can correct inaccurate data via Edit Profile.
- Erasure: You can delete your account and all data via Settings.
- Restriction: You can restrict certain processing by withdrawing consent.
- Portability: You can export your attendance data.
- Objection: You can object to certain processing activities.
- Withdrawal of consent: You can withdraw location consent at any time without affecting the legality of prior processing.

To exercise these rights, contact your organization administrator or email privacy@attendanceguard.app.

7. DATA SECURITY

- All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.
- Passwords are hashed by our authentication provider (bcrypt).
- Row-level security policies enforce that users can only access their own data and data within their organization.
- Biometric authentication is used as a local device gate. Your biometric data never leaves your device and is never sent to our servers.

8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

The Service is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us.

9. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

Your data may be processed in the region where your Supabase instance is hosted. If you are in the EU/UK, your data is processed under Standard Contractual Clauses or an adequacy decision.

Last updated: August 21, 2026

KOSD is committed to making the ClockCard and Eventa mobile applications (the "Service") accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This Accessibility Statement describes our current accessibility practices and ongoing commitments.

1. COMMITMENT TO ACCESSIBILITY

1.1 We strive to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, adapted for mobile applications, and to comply with applicable accessibility laws including the European Accessibility Act (EAA) 2025 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
1.2 Accessibility is considered during the design and development of all new features, and we conduct regular reviews to identify and address accessibility barriers.

2. ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES

2.1 Screen Reader Support: Both apps support VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android) for navigation, form input, and content reading.
2.2 Dynamic Type / Font Scaling: Text size adjusts to the user's system-level font settings for improved readability.
2.3 High Contrast: The apps respect system-level high contrast and dark mode settings.
2.4 Touch Targets: Interactive elements meet minimum touch target size guidelines (44x44 pt on iOS, 48x48 dp on Android).
2.5 Color and Contrast: We maintain a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large text and UI components.
2.6 Reduced Motion: The apps respect the system-level "Reduce Motion" setting to minimize animations.
2.7 Haptic Feedback: Check-in and check-out actions provide haptic feedback as an alternative to visual confirmation.
2.8 Biometric Authentication: Face ID and Touch ID are supported as alternatives to password entry.

3. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

3.1 Some third-party map components (used for geofence visualization) may not fully support all screen reader gestures. We are working with the map provider to improve accessibility.
3.2 Custom-drawn graphics (such as the app logo) are decorative and do not convey essential information.
3.3 We are continuously improving accessibility and welcome user feedback to help us identify areas for improvement.

4. FEEDBACK AND REPORTING

4.1 If you encounter an accessibility barrier or have suggestions for improvement, please contact us at accessibility@attendanceguard.app. Include a description of the issue, the device and OS version you are using, and the screen where the issue occurred.
4.2 We acknowledge accessibility feedback within 5 business days and strive to resolve reported issues in a future update.

5. ONGOING EFFORTS

5.1 We conduct accessibility testing during each development cycle, including automated scanning and manual testing with assistive technologies.
5.2 We track accessibility issues and prioritize fixes based on user impact.
5.3 We monitor evolving accessibility standards and update our practices accordingly.

6. CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT

We may update this Accessibility Statement as we improve the accessibility of our apps or as standards evolve.
